# Ad-Hoc Scripts
This repository displays small samples (AdHoc Scripts) of work I've done in the DevOps world. Please take a look at some of the projects I've worked on. These projects were put together in my homelab, but I have completed similar work in a professional setting. Each project is organized by folder instead of repository due to the size of these scripts (too small to require dedicated repos). 

Summary of each directory:
- ansible-projects: sample of ansible projects I've worked on to build new systems
- python-system-scripts: various python scripts for Linux systms such as obtaining running processes or renameing a large number of directories and files
- powershell: PowerShell scripts I have used in various settings such as Jenkins Pipelines
- bash: Bash scripts I have used in various settings such as Jenkins Pipelines
